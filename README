Project 4: OSS Process Scheduler Simulator
Course: CS 4760 - Operating Systems  


Description
-----------
This project simulates the process scheduling component of an operating system. It implements a multi-level feedback queue (MLFQ) scheduler that manages user processes using shared memory, message queues, and simulated system time. The 'oss' master process generates, schedules, and synchronizes with multiple 'user' processes to mimic process dispatching and execution in a real OS.

Features
--------
- Multi-level feedback queue with 3 priority levels
- Simulated logical clock (seconds + nanoseconds)
- Shared memory for process control blocks (PCB)
- Message queue-based inter-process communication
- Random process generation and randomized user behavior:
  - Full quantum usage
  - Blocking on events
  - Early termination
- Logging of queue status, dispatch events, and process metrics

File Structure
--------------
oss.c       : Master scheduler program that simulates the OS  
user.c      : Simulated user processes launched by oss  
queue.c/h   : Queue implementation and interface used by the MLFQ  
makefile    : Compiles the code into oss and user executables  
msglog.out  : Output log of simulation actions and results  
.gitignore  : Hides compiled binaries and logs from version control

Compilation & Execution
-----------------------
To Compile:
    make clean  
    make

To Run:
    ./oss -s <max_user_processes> -l <log_file> -t <max_runtime>

Example:
    ./oss -s 5 -l msglog.out -t 3

Output
------
- The scheduler logs process creation, queue transitions, and quantum usage to msglog.out  
- Every 0.5 simulated seconds, current process table and queue states are printed  
- At termination, statistics such as average wait time, CPU utilization, and queue usages are output  

Signal Handling
---------------
The project uses SIGINT to safely terminate the simulation and clean up all allocated IPC resources including:
- Shared memory  
- Message queues

Stats Collected
---------------
- Average wait time per process  
- Average blocked time  
- CPU idle time  
- Number of times each queue was used

Makefile Info
-------------
- Contains suffix rules  
- Targets:  
  - make: builds oss and user  
  - make clean: removes binaries and log files

OUTPUT
---------------
./oss -s 5 -l msglog.out -t 3

Notes
-----
- Keep log file under 10,000 lines to avoid runaway logging  
- Ensure each simulation run starts with a fresh log  
- Make sure .gitignore excludes oss, user, *.o, and msglog.out
